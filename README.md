# drawSprite
![Image](http://www.team-arg.org/images/demos/drawSprite.gif)

A function to draw several frames of a sprite to get an animation. With the drawBitmap function you had to make an array of each seprate sprite frame. Now, you can choose which frame should be shown. If you use a variable for "frame", you can make it change frames by itself.

Best part, you don't have to import every frame separately. You just make 1 big image, showing each frame in 1 column and multiple rows and import that at once. Have look at bitmaps.h you'll get it.
